# ‚öΩ EPL 2024/25 Match Result Predictor (XGBoost)

> Skip this if you're only using the CLI predictor.

### üîß Step-by-Step Training:

1. Make sure the `EPL_Results_2024_25.csv` dataset has the required columns, including `FTR` (actual full-time result).

2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### üéØ Making Predictions via CLI

```bash
python predict_game.py --features <17 float values>
```

Example:

```bash
python predict_game.py --features 1 0 12 10 5 3 8 9 5 7 1 2 0 0 2.1 3.0 3.4
```

üìä Output:
```bash
Predicted Match Result: Away_win
```

### üìà Model Details

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier  
- **Label Encoding**:
  - H ‚Üí Home win
  - D ‚Üí Draw  
  - A ‚Üí Away win  
- **Evaluation**:
  - Confusion matrix and classification report on 20% test split
  - Top 10 feature importance chart  

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

‚úÖ **Prerequisites**  
Python 3.8+  

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost joblib
```

### üöß In Development

| Feature                   | Status        | Notes  |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------|
| Web UI (Flask) and EXE    | üîÑ Ongoing    | User-friendly input + prediction interface |
| Probability Output        | üîÑ Planned    | Add model.predict_proba() to show win/draw/loss confidence |
| Batch CSV Predictions     | üîÑ Planned    | Load match data CSV ‚Üí output results in bulk |
| Hyperparameter Tuning     | ‚è≥ Todo       | Improve accuracy with GridSearchCV or Optuna |
| League Generalization     | ‚è≥ Todo       | Extend model to support multiple leagues (La Liga, Serie A, etc.) |
| REST API                  | üîÑ Planned    | Make predictions over HTTP requests (FastAPI or Flask-based API) |
| Dockerization             | ‚è≥ Todo       | Containerize for reproducibility and deployment |
